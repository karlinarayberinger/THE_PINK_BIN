<p><span style="background:#ffff00;"><strong>(31_MARCH_2022):</strong> The crime described in the screenshot below is what I think is the worst crime I have committed thus far. After getting in an argument with my mom at her house, I threw a ceramic bowl at the fireplace tile and it shattered into pieces. My mom filmed the wreckage with her phone and seemed delighted (like she was happy to have evidence to smear my reputation and to sabotage my career and self esteem). In retaliation, I threw a stainless steel teaspoon at the back of her head as she was walking away. Though she apparently was not seriously injured, I anticipate that she has or will attribute that assault to her mental decline (i.e. claim that I caused her brain damage). I cannot help but assume that the psychotronic harassment I have been experiencing and general coldness I have been on the receiving end from other people has to do with that event more than any other factor. I fear and suspect that people other than myself want to inflict harm and suffering on me in retaliation. I see myself as fundamentally a good person who deserves as good of a life as every other person. I do not condone retribution. I only condone correcting behavior, solving infrastructural/logistical problems, and preventing further harm. The spoon throwing was a failure on my part to exercise adequate self control. Then again, I was living in a “pressure cooker” of a household with my mom. Since I was a teenager (long before I ever committed a crime), my mom has been hostile to my independence. Moving forward from this adversity, I think it is in every person’s best interest for me to focus on being the best artist, academic, and problem solver I can be and to be my own parent. I think I deserve to love and to support myself unconditionally. I do not think I deserve to be punished any more than I have been (though I expect many other people would vehemently disagree. Hence, I keep to myself and expect to be be treated like an irredeemable felon by society at large. If I do not end up getting a job any time within the next 30 days, I will wait until closer to the holidays in November 2022 to apply for warehouse jobs so that I do not have to be particularly gregarious nor chirpy in exchange for money).</span></p>
