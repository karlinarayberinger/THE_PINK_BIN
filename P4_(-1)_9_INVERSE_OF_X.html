<p>INVERSE_OF_X</p>
<hr>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The following image is a drawing made by Karlina which depicts the function which inverts values of x (i.e. y = f(x) = 1 / x). Karlina had a vision of such an image since 2016 (after Karlina&#8217;s consciousness expanded as a result of consuming large amounts of cannabis edibles for the first time). The image encapsulates some of the author&#8217;s favorite mathematical concepts such as asymptotes, limits, infinity, integrals, and Boolean algebra. The black and white &#8220;stars&#8221; in the empty quadrants of the Cartesian plane represent untraversed space (perhaps in the form of parallel universes). The green squares represent finite areas. The green areas bound by y = 0, x = 0, and y = (1/x) represent indefinitely large areas. The squares which contain inscribed circles are inverses of each other in terms of color and position to reflect symmetry over asymptotes. Perhaps those squares with circles inscribed inside of them represent some finite configuration of matter and its corresponding anti-matter &#8220;twin&#8221; in some parallel universe. This image and the commentary associated with it informally encapsulate the author&#8217;s ideas about the function y = f(x) = (1/x) and epistemology in general. This piece is meant to inspire limitless exploration of nature&#8217;s beauty and mystery. It is a tribute to mathematics, science, art, and philosophy.</span></p>
