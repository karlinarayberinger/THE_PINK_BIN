<p><strong>KARLINA_SINGLENESS_MANIFESTO</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>&#8220;I, Karlina Ray Beringer, hereby declare my intent to remain single, childless, and committed to promoting every person&#8217;s authentic self expression and continued enhancement for as long as I live. Though I have been in at least one serious relationship with a best friend I thought I would spend the rest of my life with going to sleep next to and waking up to the next day (most day/night cycles) and I have had sexual intercourse and a variety of sexual/romantic/intimate activities with that best friend, I intend to mostly remain celibate for as long as I live so that I can most easily focus on my personal projects (which are usually very time-consuming and energy-consuming). I am open to making friends with people under the condition that such friendships are mutually consensual. I will do my best to minimize the net harm of the universe and to devote 100% of my time and energy towards fulfilling my highest desires.&#8221;</p>
