<p><span style="background:#ffff00;"><strong>(31_MARCH_2022):</strong> I was arrested for getting caught shoplifting at a Whole Foods. I believe that my upcoming court date has something to do with this incident because it was the most recent crime I have been convicted of (as far as I am aware). I was incarcerated for the day and not overnight. What hurt me in particular about this conviction is that it caused me to fail a background check as I was applying for a warehouse job at Amazon’s OAK5 Fulfillment Center in Newark, California. I tried re-applying for the same job in February 2022 and was told that I would have to wait until at least March 2022 for Amazon to re-submit a background check to Accurate Background rather than reuse the background check which they submitted when I applied for the job in November 2021. By time time March 2022 arrived, all the jobs I was applying for at Amazon have been filled. I anticipate that Amazon will start posting new job openings for the positions I want later this year (i.e. closer to the winter holidays). At the moment, I am tentatively considering doing a job which I have supposedly been offered at a local bar. I may just opt out of that job and wait for a less social job. Otherwise, I will wait to hear back from the bar and continue with the onboarding. It is a small store with a very small number of staff. Hence, I am not sure if I am a good fit because it would be akin to being the store manager (and I am not a huge fan of bars). I rushed to apply for the job because, recently during a phone call, my mom was verbally abusing me on the phone (by calling me a “sick girl” as in mentally disabled), threatening to cut my allowance, and demanding that I hurry up and desperately look for a source of income other than her. (When I bitterly joked that I would look for some sugar daddy to pay for me, she said “whatever” like she did not care whether I had to devolve into a prostitute to get paid).</span></p>
