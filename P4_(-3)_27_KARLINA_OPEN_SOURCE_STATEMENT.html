<p><strong>KARLINA_OPEN_SOURCE_STATEMENT</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>&#8220;I, Karlina Ray Beringer (i.e. <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://twitter.com/karbytes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@karbytes</a>), hereby declare my desire to make all of my thoughts, all of my perceptions, all of my biological activity, all of my financial activity, all of my legal records, and all of my Internet (of Things) activity freely accessible to the public and to license such intellectual property as <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/public_domain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PUBLIC_DOMAIN</a> (i.e. <strong>open source</strong>) intellectual property if released to the public by any person (especially by the mind-body whose name is Karlina Ray Beringer and who is the author of this website). I understand that myself and others may be inconvenienced by making my otherwise &#8216;private&#8217; information public and ownerless. I feel a strong sense of moral obligation to volunteer myself as a 100% transparent information processor for every human being&#8217;s welfare and continued evolution because I believe that I am especially qualified and motivated to promote free speech and anti-censorship. I believe that radical honesty is the path of least resistance and therefore of least harm.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">(Clarification: If a piece of intellectual property is <strong>public domain</strong>, then that piece of intellectual property is ownerless and therefore cannot be bought or sold by only a small number of proprietors. Everyone has equal proprietorship to public domain property because public domain is synonymous with <strong>open source</strong>. Anyone can own copies of public domain intellectual property and anyone can buy or sell copies of public domain property.).</span></p>
