<p><strong>IMPLICIT_RULES_OF_CONDUCT</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The following rules are part of a hypothetical society which the author thinks is dystopian rather than utopian. Such a dystopia is loosely based on what the author finds distasteful yet popular in American culture. Note that this piece of writing is meant to be satirical rather than serious. It was written in order to help the author feel better because the author feels depressed by how handicapped many humans are seemingly indoctrinated and bred to be.</span></p>

<p><strong>&#8220;Misery Loves Company.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><em>You are implicitly required to advertise that you suffer at least as much as your neighbors do. Otherwise, you will be ostracized and tortured until you advertise that you suffer at least as much as your neighbors do.</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>&#8220;Stop Complaining Or You Will Be Given Something To Complain About.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><em>You are not supposed to complain too seriously about anything. You are only supposed to complain if other people share in your complaints. Otherwise, you are obligated to never talk about nor write about your grievances. You are not even allowed to think about your grievances. Though police will inflict painful punishments upon you to discourage such thoughts which amount to little more than whining about yourself.</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>&#8220;You Are Born To Serve Others; Not Yourself.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><em>It is criminally self indulgent to exercise, study, pursue recreational activities, or do anything that might be construed as self-enriching unless you prioritize caring for members of your community (especially biological relatives (especially parents)) first and foremost. Your life has no value unless you matter to other people.</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>&#8220;Do Not Speak Unless Spoken To.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><em>It is not okay for you to talk to yourself out loud or internally via your &#8220;inner voice&#8221;. That would be schizophrenia. It is not okay to have imaginary friends. It is only okay to have real state-approved human friends. Only they are allowed to be the target audience of your thoughts and behaviors. Without other people to perform for, your existence is worthless and you have no human rights.</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>&#8220;O.I.N.K. Stands For &#8216;One Income, No Kids&#8217;; Not Okay!&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><em>Every adult human is obligated to marry and have biological offspring with a state-approved adult human of the opposite sex. It is not okay to be voluntarily childless. It is not okay to be voluntarily single. People who are voluntarily single and/or voluntarily childless do not deserve to work for pay. Such persons deserve to be deprived of opportunities to work, study, pursue hobbies, or do anything self-enriching until they agree to make heterosexual marriage and giving birth biological offspring their highest priority. Do not OINK like a pig! A pig is a slovenly, hideous, uncouth beast; a greedy narcissistic leech.</em></p>
<p><strong style="color:#ff0000;"><em>Note that, if you are a female-bodied human and refuse to give birth, a male-bodied human may rape you and, if you become pregnant as a result of that rape, you are legally required to give birth to the child. You are also required to raise that child as a single mother. Such measures may need to be implemented to ensure that the human population is sufficiently large and to make sure that women know their place in society: the nurturers and sex slaves.</em></strong></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>&#8220;Might Makes Right.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><em>For everyone&#8217;s convenience and to mitigate harm, you are obligated to defer to those who wield the most potential to deal physical damage. Do not attempt to outsmart those with more political power and brute strength than you. God designed life to be a constant battle so that people would have something to do other than be lazy, complacent sloths and peace whores. Not everyone will get to have adequate food, shelter, educational opportunities, and other valued commodities. Some people have to be sacrificed so that others can profit. Otherwise, no one would profit. Such competition for scarce resources makes life interesting instead of boring. War is the spice of life.</em></p>
<p><strong style="color:#ff0000;"><em>Remember that the purpose of human existence is for each human, X, to attempt to occupy as much of the finite and coveted resources as possible such that humans who are not part of X&#8217;s tribe are prevented from doing the same.</em></strong></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>&#8220;Stop Overthinking. Lean Not On Your Own Understanding.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><em>With the advent of the Internet, information overload is a real danger humans face. Humans are not designed to process very much information. Therefore, humans should limit their news intake to no more than 20 minutes per week from state-approved media sources only. Use the Internet as little as possible and with someone else present in the same room as you so that you are not tempted to stray outside the bounds of safety when web browsing. It is too easy to become misinformed, traumatized, and overly indulged when information is so abundant. Lean not on your own understanding. Never look anything up without a buddy to make sure you are not going off the deep end into conspiracy theories, cults, and distractions which take your focus off serving your family.</em></p>
<p><strong style="color:#ff0000;"><em>Pro Tip: If you do not know what to do while waiting to see people, sleep if you can. If that does not work, then watch state-approved television. Do not consume any other type of media unless you are instructed to by your state-appointed guardian or state-appointed employer. Lastly, if you are still too mentally active to be physically and mentally inert for long periods of time on demand, you will be given state-mandated psychiatric drugs to suppress unwholesome mental activity and to lower your metabolism so that you do not squirm so much.</em></strong></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>&#8220;You Are Not Allowed To Travel Without A Car.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><em>Bicycles are easy to tamper with and do not allow multiple passengers to ride in comfort and safety (and, unlike cars, bicycles have no enclosed compartment for people to fuck inside of). Hence, you are not supposed to use a bicycle as anything other than a luxury vehicle for slow, short, stop-and-go style Sunday rides with the family in the local park. If you want to leave the house, you must do so by driving a petroleum powered vehicle. The more pollution your car outputs, the better. Exhibiting a large carbon footprint signifies that you are not one of those narcissistic and bat shit insane environmentalists who are too pansy to eat meat and too stupid to understand that the Earth is meant to become inhospitable in a few decades while God&#8217;s chosen people are whisked away to an otherworldly paradise called Heaven while everyone else is left to burn in Hades on Earth. Walking is dangerous (especially for women (since women are obliged to flaunt their secondary sexual characteristics to show that they are neither men nor children nor queers)). Don&#8217;t be a whore in the streets. (Whores in the street implicitly invite people to kidnap, assault, and kill them). Be discrete and drive instead. Keep your body insulated in a tank made of metal and glass. Avoid contact with the outdoors as little as possible so that you do not go feral.</em></p>

<p><strong>&#8220;Bitch: Sit Down; Be Humble.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><em>If you are a woman (especially a of color), you gotta pack much back to earn your keep. In other words, you gotta have an ass so fat that it sticks out prominently, jiggles, and limits your mobility such that you can hardly do more than waddle like an inefficient pendulum when you attempt to run, jump, or climb. Also, you gotta have breasts that stick out prominently and corseted in a manner which makes them look like plumped up buttocks (so He has something alluring and distracting to look at other than your stupid face which does little more than pout, moo, oink, moan, caterwaul shrilly, whimper, babble incoherently, shriek like a colicky infant, and otherwise make unintelligent animal noises). You are not designed to be aerodynamic nor physically durable. Only a man is. A voluptuous figure weighed down by swollen, pendulous breasts and buttocks signifies your loyalty as a woman; your willingness to stay put where your man wants you to be; dutifully looking over His estate and His (exclusively male) heirs to the throne rather than running around promiscuously and in an unbridled manner. Also, you gotta let your muscles stay small like a child&#8217;s so that you invoke a man&#8217;s protective instinct rather than his instinct to strike his competitors down. Do not look like a man. Wear cosmetics and clothing which accentuates your fragility, passivity, sensuality, fertility, softness, youthfulness, naivete, and smallness of mind. Speak softly and seductively. Use small and simple words and phrases which are colloquial rather than esoteric. Do not be too direct nor literal with your words. Giggle politely but do not guffaw in genuine rapture (and do not try to be a comedian yourself since you nothing but food, family, and your decaying body to talk about). Move slowly. Walk with a short and slightly hobbled stride like you have a stick up your ass. (High heeled shoes help to enforce such an appropriately inefficient and lame gate (because guys think it&#8217;s cute and disarming when you look so foolish, uptight, and easy to topple over like a pig trotting on tiny hooves with gigantic thighs bulging out of restrictive fabrics)). Act a little bitchy, snooty, passive-aggressive, sulky, and crazy to show that you are humble rather than full of yourself. Avoid bragging at all costs (but <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twerking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">twerk</a> like your life depends on it). You are only allowed to develop skills which pertain to cooking, child rearing, women&#8217;s fashion, seducing and sexually gratifying heterosexual men, cheap and homely arts and crafts, and social studies. Avoid natural sciences, mathematics, and technology since those domains are a bit too impersonal for someone who is only groomed to find meaning in her relationships with other humans.</em></p>
<p><strong style="color:#ff0000;"><em>Remember that women have been shaped through sexual selection over many generations to cater to a man&#8217;s desire. Women have been domesticated to resemble children in every manner except for their sexual and reproductive faculties. Hence, a woman is supposed to be treated like a child who never grows up. She is not supposed to travel without a male escort. She is a piece of property which must be assigned to a male owner. She is not fit to own herself. Get over it! Embrace your God-ordained femininity and be happy to serve His purpose.</em></strong></p>
