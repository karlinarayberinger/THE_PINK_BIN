<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">Note that this journal entry is a parody and that the author of this journal entry is not a <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christian</a>. Hence, the author of this website (who is also the author of this journal entry and the web page which encapsulates it) is &#8220;supposed to&#8221; go to Hell eventually.</span></p>
<hr>
<p>The word &#8220;self&#8221; might as well be a reference to The Devil (and The Devil is prone to violence, anger, stupidity, greed, preventable disease, and actions commonly and authoritatively deemed to be sins).</p>
<p>By contrast, the word &#8220;Jesus&#8221; might as well be a reference to the default (and most important) subject (and audience) of every conversation.</p>
<p>(Note that Jesus is God while temporarily confined to the body of exactly one human being (which was birthed out of some virgin named Mary (suggesting that the father of Jesus is God and that the mother of Jesus is a mere human) for the purpose of Jesus being slaughtered once he attained approximately 30 years of age by human beings in order to &#8220;pay for all of the sins which humanity ever committed and will ever commit&#8221;. Since Jesus was crucified and left to die while his hands and feet were nailed to a wooden torture contraption, he has allegedly been transformed into an immortal humanlike representative of God who, like Harriet Tubman helping slaves escape in the night while their captors were not looking, offers selected human mortals the opportunity to become immortal and increasingly virtuous (until maximum virtuousness is attained and the person is immutably prevented from ever committing a single sin again (because Jesus never committed a sin and never will commit a sin (which makes Jesus the most ideal role model for human mortals to emulate)))).</p>
<p>As long as a human mortal appoints Jesus to be that human mortal&#8217;s highest authority figure (in place of The Devil), that human being is guaranteed to attain immortality and God&#8217;s approval and kindness. Otherwise, that human mortal is insinuating that it does not want such gifts of salvation and is relegated to be tortured eternally in Hell once that human mortal dies. (Sincerely loyal followers of Jesus will be whisked away to Heaven once they die. Heaven is a paradise and not a torture chamber).</p>
<p>(Note that a human mortal is not necessarily &#8220;safe&#8221; (i.e. guaranteed salvation from Hell) until that human mortal dies and is deemed by God to be a sufficiently loyal follower of Jesus. In other words, it is possible for a former Christian to devolve into an ex Christian and hence go from having a handle on Heaven to being set to end up in Hell once again (until and unless that ex Christian returns to The Faith before that ex Christian dies)).</p>
<p>The &#8220;choice&#8221; is yours: defer to Authority or suffer more than you can stand forever (and where you cannot ever commit suicide, go to sleep, or get any real break from being tortured in ways which make you wish to be dead). Given these facts, it would be pretty stupid of you not to surrender to Jesus and let him be your driver.</p>

<p>Post Script: bare in mind that many human mortals have died while having rejected Jesus&#8217; gift of eternal life and salvation from the brutality of Hell. It is extremely likely that many more human mortals will be cast away into Hell because they rejected The Gift of Salvation while they had that finite window of opportunity to accept the offer. Therefore, do not worry too much about those who seem hesitant to surrender to Jesus. Instead, worry about those who share in The Faith. As long as Jesus is your driver, you can do no wrong.</p>
