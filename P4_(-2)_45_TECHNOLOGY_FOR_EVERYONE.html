<p><strong>TECHNOLOGY_FOR_EVERYONE</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>One of the main goals of this website (<a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karbytesforlife.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karbytes For Life dot WordPress dot Com</a>) is to provide free and pragmatic advice and inspiration to help any person become a skilled user of computers and the Internet and to make software development accessible to everyone (as part of a healthy, balanced lifestyle and lifelong learning). I am very enthusiastic about computer programming and think it is a very engaging, rewarding, and accessible way to study mathematics and to derive a sense of genuine accomplishment (especially since feedback is relatively instantaneous and based on objective rather than subjective factors). Computer science is very egalitarian, objective, and non-partisan. Either a progam accomplishes a task or else it does not. The computer does not care how good you look, how rich you are, how many friends you have, how talented you think you are, et cetera. The computer just does as it is programmed to do.</p>
<p>The circumstances in which this website was born were me feeling deprived of a place to work indoors where I did not feel intruded upon or otherwise impeded by my environment. For several years, I spent most of my time outside of my legal residence in an effort to go from being &#8220;homeless&#8221; to being able to pay for my own rent and to enjoy a full-time career in Information Technology. To make a long story short, I learned that it is extremely difficult to work on a computer outdoors due to a lack of electricity on tap, metered Internet access (which is insufficient for data-intensive tasks such as re-installing operating systems), humidity (which may cause electronics to short circuit), environmental noise, increased vulnerability to thieves, and other inconveniences which those who have private indoor office spaces with non-metered Internet access and electricity &#8220;on tap&#8221; almost never have to deal with.</p>
<p>I went to extremes to prove to myself that it is possible to get a lot of Information Technology work done using little more than a heavy-duty camping backpack, power banks with AC outlets, a decent laptop with a Linux operating system installed, and an Android phone which is enabled to establish a mobile Internet hotspot via USB-tethering to the laptop. Now that I am fairly convinced that I have the experience, knowledge, and equipment required to do software development outdoors, I am ready to make the backyard at my legal residence my main office space. That yard offers decent non-metered Wi-Fi Internet access, a bathroom, electrical outlets, and a fairly secluded location to work for hours at at a time on my laptop. (I prefer to work outdoors than indoors because being indoors for too long tends to make me feel depressed and claustrophobic).</p>
<p>Anyway, as this website continues to evolve, I hope to create useful documentation which would help anyone (especially a homeless person) go from knowing very little about Information Technology to becoming an expert in the Information Technology field. It would give such a person a lifelong hobby, something to continuously study (as computer technologies continue to evolve), and ideally a safe and engaging means to earn money and/or to contribute one&#8217;s skills to the open source community. (Even if one does not get paid to be a tech expert, one can still contribute to society as a volunteer).</p>
<p>Many educational resources and community support forums exist on the World Wide Web to engage people at all skill levels. This website is not meant to be a substitute for such resources. This website is simply one person&#8217;s public journal documenting how that person went from being practically homeless, unemployed, and relegated to the lowest echelons of society as a violent felon and criminal with an extensive criminal record (mostly for petty theft at grocery stores) to someone who will, hopefully, be able to pay for its own rent, live on its own in an apartment for one, and enjoy a full-time Information Technology career with plenty of time to enjoy hobbies such as making music, reading books, watching great films, traveling, et cetera.</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">Bottom Line: Many free or low-cost educational and social support resources exist which can help even the most destitute persons acquire Information Technology skills, get professional certifications by passing exams, and find a good career doing software development, software quality assurance testing, and other tech-related professions.*</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;">(Some good online communities and educational resources for tech enthusiasts of all skill levels is <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>, <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://ubuntu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubuntu</a>, <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://www.coursera.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coursera</a>, and <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Free Code Camp</a>).</span></p>
<p>* Note that some people may be trapped in circumstances which do not enable such persons to access the modern Internet. The author&#8217;s primary website (<a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a>) is designed to provide spiritual support for all sentient beings unconditionally; to help each person achieve a sense of unconditional satisfaction in existing and in being an immutable and essential part of <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nature</a>. The author of this website promotes the idea that all of reality is contained within one mind and that consciousness is the most fundamental, irreducible, ubiquitous, and permanent substrate in which all forms are inscribed. Such a belief (i.e. <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/panpsychism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">panpsychism</a>) may help a person achieve a sense of immortality by identifying as the mind which dreams up all subjective reality bubbles rather than believing that a person is merely a fleeting piece of a dream. <span style="background:#00ffff;">If the panpsychic hypothesis is true, then every person has &#8220;The Holy Spirit&#8221; as a witness, companion, and source of creative power at all times.</span></p>
