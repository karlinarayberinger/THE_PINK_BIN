<p><span style="background:#ffff00;"><strong>(31_MARCH_2022):</strong> Though my memory of this incident is vague, I do remember being very angry that my mother evicted me from her house and filed a restraining order against me such that I was being forced to live at my dad’s house as my last option before becoming homeless. I did not want to be relegated to that stifling little room which did not feel sufficiently private and which felt like my mother trying to punish me more than the state did. Hence, I threw a brick through the window of my bedroom from the outside and was arrested and taken to John George Psychiatric Pavilion. I do think that I was in bad mental health that year. Fortunately, my dad was forgiving enough to let me continue residing at his house (and he fixed the window while I was incarcerated). I think it is important to note that, before I committed the violent assault which lead to my mom evicting me, I was doing a phone interview at home for a remote JavaScript job. Rather than attempt to work from home in a location which has a weaker Wi-Fi connection than most public Wi-Fi networks (perhaps in order to deliberately prevent me from working from home out of retribution and/or to prevent me from getting into another domestic dispute with my parents), I had since only worked outside the home for no longer than six months at one job in the hospitality, retail, and food service sector (which I personally do not enjoy but did anyway because I was desperate to empower myself economically and did not want to feel cut off from the world outside of my home).</span></p>
