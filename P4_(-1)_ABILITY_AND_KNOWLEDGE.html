<p>Okay&#8230;this is it: the final component page to add to &#8220;The Pink Bin&#8221; of Karbytes For Life dot WordPress dot Com.</p>
<p>My worst case scenario would be becoming paralyzed from the neck down (or whole body) and left to rot and possibly be tortured and deprived of means to communicate with the world outside my head.</p>
<p>(I am deeply grateful for the fact that my brain is hooked up to something akin to the <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuralink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neuralink</a> brain-to-computer interface. Although I seem to have no private nervous system activity and no private subjective qualia which I would otherwise be the first, last, and only experiencer of, I am glad that my mind-body is digitally codifiable as a hologram. I look forward to becoming ever more godlike. Yes I do believe Reality is a computer simulation which dreams up its own &#8220;hardware&#8221;).</p>
<p>Okay&#8230;back to what I was saying before I divulged my favorite pieces of knowledge which I attempted to encapsulate inside of &#8220;The Pink Bin&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>Suppose I were fully paralyzed and held hostage in some underground torture chamber where I was subject to excruciating physical and psychological torture. What would I do to make my existence feel personally worthwhile? Here is what I would do: I would attempt to become a &#8220;zen master&#8221; and master the art of being content with each and every circumstance which I pass through (or, more accurately which passes through me).</p>
<p>Suppose things got worse for me and the following happened instead: everything above plus not being able to remember things when I do a self query for the pieces of my knowledge I wish to re-experience and to use as the fodder for new creative imaginings. It could be that neural implants would block the firing of specific circuits in my brain so that I would not be able to learn, remember, or derive satisfaction from any phenomena which I would be experiencing. I would probably go insane and have no choice but to decay into a torture porn projector.</p>
<p>Thank you, and good night!</p>
